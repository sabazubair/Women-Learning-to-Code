# Reviewing W3D1: Data types, Variables, Conditionals
- examples going over data types
- variables
- string concatenation - make a message
- conditionals

# 5 W’s on Functions (one of the composite data types) (1st hour)
- What are functions?? Think of them as tools. What's a tool you have
- Who uses functions? well we all do! excel has functions
- When do you use functions? want to lessen repetitive code - this is a code pillar. making your life easier. do one thing
- Where? everywhere!
- Why? want to write less code - why is this important? well imagine this scenario. you relaize you need to make a change. BIG PAIN IN THE BUTT.

 # Terminology: call, parameter, argument, parentheses, “curly braces”
 ```js
- function name(parameter) {}
```
- parameter is essentially a variable you use inside the function
- argument is when you actually store something inside or the value you set for the variable
- once you define a function, you have to call it.

```js
function hiThere() {
	2 + 2
}

hiThere()
```

- Note: Syntax + Code Indentation

# Return statement (2nd hour)
- but you got nothing? what happened? the return statement
- return statement is essentially telling to computer to actually send you the result back. It does the work but it doesn't know that you actually want to have it. scenario: I did the work? But why didnt you tell me you did it already?? Well you didnt tell me

```js
function hiThere() {
	return 2 + 2
}
```

- but hey, what about console.log? Doesnt that give you the value back? Not really, it just prints but inside the function, it doesn't actually provide the value back (like a screenshot)

# Purpose of functions
- but seriously what's the point of running these functions? well it allows you to do 2 things:
- get repetitive stuff done without copying and pasting
- get a final result and save it inside a variable!

# SCOPE! with variables
- scope inside curly brackets, inside function and outside of function
- can't get access to stuff inside functions
- kind of like houses

# Built-in Functions
- console.log()
- Number()

# if/else statements + pseudocode (3rd hour)
    - analogies like holidays
    - analogies like brushing teeth
    - introduce pseudocode
    - Pseudocode
        - what is it? writing in English or whatever language to break down the steps without writing the code
        - i.e. when awesomeTime = 4,
- Instructor note: Use of console.log(), analogies and pseudocode is a great idea.
