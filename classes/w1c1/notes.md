# Overview of course (1st hour)
- Before we get into who we are, let's give you an overview of the course b/c you might be wondering, what on earth did I get myself into??
    - learn about how to build an interactive website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery and the Openweathermap API - which you'll get first-hand experience by building out a website that helps you tell the weather in a city
    - How we plan to do this:
        - classes - don't see them as lectures, see it as a conversation. Instructors will share concepts and provide chances to practice through examples or through the project. This is also one of many places to ask questions. If you're stuck on something, mentor will help you out on Zoom or if necessary, move the conversation to Slack
        - Saturday checkin - this allows us to spend time with you 1:1 to address any further questions/concerns/ thoughts you have for just over 20 mins
        - Slack - place to have share information, ask questions, have discussions and connect with past alumni. This is also where we'll post a weekly tech topic to engage everyone
        - Notion - This is where you'll find staff bios, lesson recaps, and Saturday check in schedule for all of you. This will be biweekly for each of you so make sure to check when your check in is scheduled. In the last week, everyone will attend for an hour.

# Creating Intent + Setting a Goal (2nd hour)
- This is a huge step for all of us (yes including us instructors and mentors!) so let's start off the course with some goal-setting
- write 3 goals in your own space - show how to do it
- This isn't for you to share with any of us but more of a mental goal for yourself so you are mindful

# Tips from Us: How to Succeed
- Come on time. This will help you succeed b/c you can maximize time with all of us.
- Tell yourself you are capable of learning this. Many barriers are our own mental barriers. Mine continues to be that no concept is out of my reach of learning. I'd like us to take 5 minutes to get a piece of paper, draw out the words - 'I am capable' and tape it to the wall near you. I want to see pictures in the slack channel after!
- Get comfortable with discomfort - you're going to experience alot of times where you feel you don't understand something. This can get reallll frustrating. But it's okay. It just means you are growing.
- Be patient with yourself - this is a lot of information so it's okay if you feel your brain isn't making connections fast enough.
- Ask for help - we have alll been where you were in different forms. So the only expectation is that you have tried to look it up for a few mins and then leverage your peers and all of us! And don't feel afraid to tell us what you need in order to learn and we will try our best!
- Have fun! As frustrating as it can be at times, we want you to enjoy what you are learning.
