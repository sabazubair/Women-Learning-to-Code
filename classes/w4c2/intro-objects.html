    <h1>Intro to Objects</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In our review, we saw that arrays are officially documented as
        "list-like objects". Remember that definition. You'll understand it
        entirely by the end of this lecture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a
        model of something that you would recognize from the real world.
      </li>
      <li>In an object, variables become known as properties.</li>
      <li>In an object, functions become known as methods.</li>
      <li>
        Visually: objects have {} (in the same way arrays have []) but unlike
        arrays, objects are not indexed. Order does not matter. Objects are
        created in key/value pairs.
      </li>
      <li>Key's are unique!</li>
      <li>
        We can access data stored in an object using either the dot notation or
        the square bracket notation.
      </li>
    </ol>

    let hotel = {
      name: "Four Seasons",
      rooms: 25,
      booked: 20,
      gym: true,
      roomTypes: ["twin", "double", "suite"],
      checkAvailability: function () {
        return this.rooms - this.booked;
      },
    };
    console.log(hotel);

    // console.log(hotel.name);
    // console.log(hotel.booked);
    // console.log(hotel["booked"]);
    // console.log(hotel.checkAvailability());

    // RE-ASSIGN VALUES
    // hotel.gym = false;

    // ADD PROPERTIES
    // hotel.pool = true;
    // hotel["pool"] = true;

    // DELETE PROPERTIES
    // delete hotel.booked;
    // console.log(hotel);
