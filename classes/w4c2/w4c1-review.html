    <h1>Arrays</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>often described as a list; official definition: list-like object</li>
      <li>square brackets; we refer to items in arrays as "elements"</li>
      <li>i.e. [elem1, elem2, elem3]</li>
      <li>arrays are indexed; start at 0</li>
      <li>
        contain any type of element: arrays can have arrays, numbers, strings,
        booleans, objects. Example: let arr = [0, false, "hello", [], ...]
      </li>
      <li>
        Array length is variable. In other words: arrays can be empty, or be
        4.29 billion elements max. (I checked!)
      </li>
      <li>
        TL;DR; array is a powerful data structure (or: a way to store data)!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Loops</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        loops are commonly used with arrays; hence, why we taught them together.
        Last class, you learned for loops & while loops.
      </li>
      <li>
        Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then
        the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the
        code block will run again.
      </li>
      <li>It repeats until the condition returns false.</li>
      <li>
        There are 5 different loops in Javascript - for, while, do...while,
        for...in, for...of. If you understand the top two, you'll have no
        problem understanding the bottom 3. TBH: I've only ever used the for
        loop out of this list.
      </li>
      <li>The most common loop in Javascript is the for loop.</li>
      <li>
        for loop, from the onset, is made up of 3 statements; initialization,
        condition, update.
      </li>
      <li>
        "for" keyword, (let i=0 ...) is the initialization; creates variable i;
        sometimes called index.
      </li>
      <li>
        for (let i = 0; i < 10 ...) - is the condition; the value of i was
        initially set to 0, so in this case, the loop will run 10 times before
        stopping
      </li>
      <li>
        for (let i=0; i < 10; i++) - update statement; how would you like the
        loop to proceed. There is also the decrement operator.
      </li>
      <li>
        for (i=0; i > 10; i++) {code block} - what you'd like to occur every
        time the loop runs
      </li>
      <li>
        The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified
        condition is true.
      </li>
      <li>
        IRL, you'll be most encouraged to use: map, reduce, filter to loop, or
        "iterate" + perform a transformation on arrays. They are similar to for
        and while loops.
      </li>
    </ul>

    // NOTE: `This is template literal syntax. This is just a string, created with backticks, and the use of the dollar sign + {} indicate a variable, i.e. ${variable}.`
    // Let's write a for loop.
    // for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    //   console.log(`${i} and anything i write here is a regular string`);
    // }

    // While Loop Example
    // let text = "";
    // let i = 0;
    // while (i < 10) {
    //   text = `The number is ${i}`;
    //   i++;
    //   console.log(text);
    // }

    // Write Javascript Here
    // let arr = ["Hello", 8, true, ["dog", "cat", "turtle"]];
    // for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    //   console.log(arr[i]);
    // }
  </script>
