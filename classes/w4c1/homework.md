# Homework

1. Why do we use loops?
2. When do we use for loops vs while loops?
3. Write a for loop that runs 10 loops with a console.log printing 'I am on loop: <loop number>' up to 10.
Should print out like this:
```js
I am on loop: 1
I am on loop: 2
...
```
4. Convert this for loop into a while loop
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log('Change me into a while loop! ' + i)
}
```
5. Help me remember your names! Write a for loop that loops through an array of strings of all the names of students in your cohort, and print out using console.log 'There is a student named <name>.'
Should print out like this:
```js
There is a student named ABCDEF.
There is a student named GHIJKLM.
...
```
