- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
- core web technology
- colors/fonts/text, illustrations, layouts, animations
- 3 ways to write CSS (2 internal, 1 external)
- CSS syntax
  - selector: {
    CSSproperty: value;
    }
- selectors
  - element
  - class
  - ids
  - attribute\* (We'll see this in our weather project.)
  - \*
    (Many ways to select! You don't have to memorize them all. We always have documentation on hand.)
- specificity
  - cascading style sheets can anecdotally be understood as "fighting stylesheets". specificity determines which rule is applied at runtime.
    - inline style (most specific), id, class, element
- box model (margin, padding)
  - concept illustrated best with pesticide browser plugin
  - elements in html have boxes around them
  - margin is the space around the box, padding is the space in between the box
- inspector
- blog code-along
